## 4. Create Astra DB Instance

**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.

#### ‚úÖ 4a. Register 

If you do have an account yet register and sign In to Astra DB this is FREE and NO CREDIT CARD asked** [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.dev/11-22): You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_

#### ‚úÖ 4b. Create a "FREE" plan

Follow this [guide](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html), to set up a pay as you go database with a free $25 monthly credit. You will find below recommended values to enter:

- **For the database name** - `workshops`

- **For the keyspace name** - `spring_petclinic`

_You can technically use whatever you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._

- **For provider and region**: Choose a provider (GCP, Azure or AWS) and then the related region is where your database will reside physically (choose one close to you or your users).

- **Create the database**. Review all the fields to make sure they are as shown, and click the `Create Database` button.

You will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard.

![my-pic](doc/img//db-pending.png?raw=true)

The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

**üëÅÔ∏è Walkthrough**

*The Walkthrough mentionned the wrong keyspace, make sure to use `spring_petclinic`*

## 5. Create your schema with CQL Console

#### ‚úÖ 5a. Select keyspace in CQL Console

As seen in the slides on the contrary of relational you start with the request and data model BEFORE CODING.

![image](doc/img/db-cqlconsole-1.png?raw=true)

 Let's create the tables. In the console use the command:

```sql
use spring_petclinic;
```

![image](doc/img/db-cqlconsole-2.png?raw=true)

#### ‚úÖ 5b. Create tables

This is the data model we are looking for with 6 tables.

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/data-model.png?raw=true)

Execute the following in the cql console

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS petclinic_idx_vetname;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS petclinic_idx_ownername;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_vet;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_vet_by_specialty;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_reference_lists;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_owner;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_pet_by_owner;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_visit_by_pet;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_vet (
  id          uuid,
  first_name  text,
  last_name   text,
  specialties set<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((id))
);


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_vet_by_specialty (
 specialty   text,
 vet_id      uuid,
 first_name  text,
 last_name   text,
 PRIMARY KEY ((specialty), vet_id)
);


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_owner (
  id         uuid,
  first_name text,
  last_name  text,
  address    text,
  city       text,
  telephone  text,
  PRIMARY KEY ((id))
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_pet_by_owner (
  owner_id   uuid,
  pet_id     uuid,
  pet_type   text,
  name       text,
  birth_date date,
  PRIMARY KEY ((owner_id), pet_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_visit_by_pet (
   pet_id      uuid,
   visit_id    uuid,
   visit_date  date,
   description text,
   PRIMARY KEY ((pet_id), visit_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_reference_lists (
  list_name text,
  values set<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((list_name))
);

/** We could search veterinarians by their names. */
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_idx_ownername ON petclinic_owner(last_name);
/** We could search vet by their names. */
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_idx_vetname ON petclinic_vet(last_name);
```

#### ‚úÖ 5c. Check our 6 tables

```sql
describe tables;
```

#### ‚úÖ 5d. Insert Reference Data

```sql
INSERT INTO petclinic_reference_lists(list_name, values) 
VALUES ('pet_type ', {'bird', 'cat', 'dog', 'lizard','hamster','snake'});

INSERT INTO petclinic_reference_lists(list_name, values) 
VALUES ('vet_specialty', {'radiology', 'dentistry', 'surgery'});
```

## 6. Create Astra Token

To connect to the database from Java code we need some credentials, this is what we are doing here.

#### ‚úÖ 6a. Generate Token

Following the [Manage Application Tokens docs](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) create a token with `Database Admnistrator` roles.

- Go the `Organization Settings`

- Go to `Token Management`

- Pick the role `Database Admnistrator` on the select box

- Click Generate token

**üëÅÔ∏è Walkthrough**

![image](doc/img/astra-create-token.gif?raw=true)

This is what the token page looks like. You can now download the values as a CSV. We will need those values but you can also keep this window open for use later.

![image](doc/img/astra-token.png?raw=true)

Notice the clipboard icon at the end of each value.

- `clientId:` We will use it as a _username_ to contact Cassandra

- `clientSecret:` We will use it as a _password_ to contact Cassandra

- `appToken:` We will use it as a api token Key to interact with APIs.

#### ‚úÖ 6b. Copy your token in your clipboard

To know more about roles of each token you can have a look to [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRqu44W-bMU)

**Note: Make sure you don't close the window accidentally or otherwise - if you close this window before you copy the values, the application token is lost forever. They won't be available later for security reasons.**

We are now set with the database and credentials. Let's start coding with Spring !

### 7. Start Gitpod and setup your application

#### ‚úÖ 7a Open Gitpod

Click the button below it should route you to your workspace:
[https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive)

When you first launch gitpod, it builds the image.
![image](doc/img/building-workspace.png?raw=true)

Git pod pulls the image.
![image](doc/img/pulling-image.png?raw=true)


#### ‚úÖ 7b Know your gitpod

Gitpod exposes some ports that we will need later

```bash
gp url 8080
gp url 3000
```

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/swagger.png?raw=true)

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/logical-architecture.png?raw=true)

- `spring-parclinic-angular`: This is the existing project that provides a user interface implementation using Angular. It has been used as well for other backend projects like the
**spring-petclinic-rest**

- `prometheus`: Our component exposes some metrics through the actuator endpoint. A registry will push this information into the Prometheus database (docker-based).

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/prometheus.png?raw=true)

- `Grafana`: Allows to create dashboards based on data stored in prometheus.

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/grafana.png?raw=true)

- `zipkin`: Our component includes the `spring-cloud-sleuth` dependency allowing Brave to push metrics usage of the API to the distributed tracing component Zipkin. To enable this tracing
set the property `zipkin.enabled` to true in `application.yaml`.
To start zipkin use `docker-compose up -d`

```
  zipkin:
    enabled: true
    baseUrl: http://localhost:9411
    sender:
      type: web
```

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/zipkin.png?raw=true)

- `Apache Cassandra`: A NoSQL database

- `DataStax Astra` : Apache Cassandra available in the Cloud for free as a managed service (DBaas)


### Data Model diagram

The underlying data model implemented in Apache Cassandra is different from the one you would have defined with a relational database.

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/data-model.png?raw=true)

To enable scalability, Apache Cassandra does not support joins or integrity constraints. Therefore we used some denormalization.
We also created some `secondary indices` to queries columns that are not the PARTITION KEY. These secondary indices work well in this case because the cardinality is low (e.g, few pets for an owner).

The application generates the objects related to the data model (e.g., tables, indices, udts) at startup.
