## 4. Create Astra DB Instance

**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.

#### ‚úÖ 4a. Register 

If you do have an account yet register and sign In to Astra DB this is FREE and NO CREDIT CARD asked** [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.dev/11-22): You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_

#### ‚úÖ 4b. Create a "FREE" plan

Follow this [guide](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html), to set up a pay as you go database with a free $25 monthly credit. You will find below recommended values to enter:

- **For the database name** - `workshops`

- **For the keyspace name** - `spring_petclinic`

_You can technically use whatever you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._

- **For provider and region**: Choose a provider (GCP, Azure or AWS) and then the related region is where your database will reside physically (choose one close to you or your users).

- **Create the database**. Review all the fields to make sure they are as shown, and click the `Create Database` button.

You will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard.

![my-pic](doc/img//db-pending.png?raw=true)

The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

**üëÅÔ∏è Walkthrough**

*The Walkthrough mentionned the wrong keyspace, make sure to use `spring_petclinic`*

## 5. Create your schema with CQL Console

#### ‚úÖ 5a. Select keyspace in CQL Console

As seen in the slides on the contrary of relational you start with the request and data model BEFORE CODING.

![image](doc/img/db-cqlconsole-1.png?raw=true)

 Let's create the tables. In the console use the command:

```sql
use spring_petclinic;
```

![image](doc/img/db-cqlconsole-2.png?raw=true)

#### ‚úÖ 5b. Create tables

This is the data model we are looking for with 6 tables.

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/data-model.png?raw=true)

Execute the following in the cql console

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS petclinic_idx_vetname;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS petclinic_idx_ownername;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_vet;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_vet_by_specialty;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_reference_lists;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_owner;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_pet_by_owner;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_visit_by_pet;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_vet (
  id          uuid,
  first_name  text,
  last_name   text,
  specialties set<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((id))
);


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_vet_by_specialty (
 specialty   text,
 vet_id      uuid,
 first_name  text,
 last_name   text,
 PRIMARY KEY ((specialty), vet_id)
);


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_owner (
  id         uuid,
  first_name text,
  last_name  text,
  address    text,
  city       text,
  telephone  text,
  PRIMARY KEY ((id))
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_pet_by_owner (
  owner_id   uuid,
  pet_id     uuid,
  pet_type   text,
  name       text,
  birth_date date,
  PRIMARY KEY ((owner_id), pet_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_visit_by_pet (
   pet_id      uuid,
   visit_id    uuid,
   visit_date  date,
   description text,
   PRIMARY KEY ((pet_id), visit_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_reference_lists (
  list_name text,
  values set<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((list_name))
);

/** We could search veterinarians by their names. */
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_idx_ownername ON petclinic_owner(last_name);
/** We could search vet by their names. */
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_idx_vetname ON petclinic_vet(last_name);
```

#### ‚úÖ 5c. Check our 6 tables

```sql
describe tables;
```

#### ‚úÖ 5d. Insert Reference Data

```sql
INSERT INTO petclinic_reference_lists(list_name, values) 
VALUES ('pet_type ', {'bird', 'cat', 'dog', 'lizard','hamster','snake'});

INSERT INTO petclinic_reference_lists(list_name, values) 
VALUES ('vet_specialty', {'radiology', 'dentistry', 'surgery'});
```

## 6. Create Astra Token

To connect to the database from Java code we need some credentials, this is what we are doing here.

#### ‚úÖ 6a. Generate Token

Following the [Manage Application Tokens docs](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) create a token with `Database Admnistrator` roles.

- Go the `Organization Settings`

- Go to `Token Management`

- Pick the role `Database Admnistrator` on the select box

- Click Generate token

**üëÅÔ∏è Walkthrough**

![image](doc/img/astra-create-token.gif?raw=true)

This is what the token page looks like. You can now download the values as a CSV. We will need those values but you can also keep this window open for use later.

![image](doc/img/astra-token.png?raw=true)

Notice the clipboard icon at the end of each value.

- `clientId:` We will use it as a _username_ to contact Cassandra

- `clientSecret:` We will use it as a _password_ to contact Cassandra

- `appToken:` We will use it as a api token Key to interact with APIs.

#### ‚úÖ 6b. Copy your token in your clipboard

To know more about roles of each token you can have a look to [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRqu44W-bMU)

**Note: Make sure you don't close the window accidentally or otherwise - if you close this window before you copy the values, the application token is lost forever. They won't be available later for security reasons.**

We are now set with the database and credentials. Let's start coding with Spring !

### 7. Start Gitpod and Setup your application

#### ‚úÖ 7a. Open Gitpod

Click the button below it should route you to your workspace:
[https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive)

When you first launch gitpod, it builds the image.
![image](doc/img/building-workspace.png?raw=true)

Git pod pulls the image.
![image](doc/img/pulling-image.png?raw=true)


#### üìò Home Screen

This is the home Screen. It is a VSCode instance in the cloud. As you can seeNotice multiple panels are opens with 2 terminals, the readme and the explorer. 
![image](doc/img/start-ui.png?raw=true)

#### üìò How to open a new terminal

You can open a new terminal from the menu in the ellipsis in the top left hand corner. Then use the Switch termina panel to move from another.
![image](doc/img/gitpod-new-terminal.png?raw=true)


#### ‚úÖ 7b. Know your gitpod


- **üìò All tools are installed**

Gitpod provide everything you need to work with JAVA, NODEJS (but also python, docker and many more). Open a new **TERMINAL** and enter the following command.

```bash
java --version

- **üìò Simple Browser preview**

As of now **nothing IS running** but if you want to open a preview or a new browser use the icons as show below.

![image](doc/img/gitpod-preview.png?raw=true)


#### ‚úÖ 7c. Setup your application

Locate the File `application.yaml` in the folder `src/main/resources`, there your 3 properties to update marked with `CHANGE_ME`.

```yaml
server:
  port: 9966

logging:
  pattern:
    console: "%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %magenta(%-5level) %cyan(%-45logger) : %msg%n"
  level:
    root: WARN
    com.datastax.workshop: INFO
    com.datastax.astra: INFO
    com.datastax.stargate: INFO
    com.datastax.oss.driver: ERROR
    com.sprinframework.test: ERROR
    ch.qos.logback.classic: ERROR
    
# Setup your application
astra:
  application-token: <CHANGE_ME>
  database-id: <CHANGE_ME>
  database-region: <CHANGE_ME>
  keyspace: spring_petclinic
  metrics:
    enabled: false
```

- *The DatabaseID is located on the home page*
![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/astra-config-1.png?raw=true)

- *The Database region (adn keyspace) are located in the details page*
![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/astra-config-2.png?raw=true)

- *Make sure the Token local like `AstraCS:xxxxxxxxxxx:yyyyyyyyyyy*

#### ‚úÖ 7d. Validate your setup

Have a look to the code of [`Test01_Connectivity`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/test/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/Test01_Connectivity.java) here we use the `CqlSession` and `AstraClient` to show some infromations regarding your Astra DB. Execute the test with:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test01_Connectivity
```

> üñ•Ô∏è Expected output
```bash
== CQL_SESSION ==
+ Your Keyspace: spring_petclinic
+ Vet Specialty: 
[dentistry, radiology, surgery]
== ASTRA ==
+ Your OrganizationID: f9460f14-9879-4ebe-83f2-48d3f3dce13c
+ Your Databases:

```

## 8. Working with DAO

#### ‚úÖ 8a. The CqlSession

The integration to Cassandra is always implemented through the `CqlSession`. A first way to implement a DAO is to just use this object explicitely. Check the code of [`Test02_DaoWithCqlSession`]https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/test/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/Test02_WorkingWithDao.java) and run the following test:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test02_DaoWithCqlSession
```

Notice how you need to put a terminal call `block()` or use the `StepVerifier` included in Spring Reactive.

```java
@Test
public void should_list_vet_specialies() {
 System.out.println(referenceListDao
   .findReferenceList("vet_specialty").block());
        
 StepVerifier
  .create(referenceListDao.findReferenceList("vet_specialty"))
  .expectNext(Set.of("dentistry", "radiology", "surgery"))
  .expectComplete()
  .verify();
}
```

#### ‚úÖ 8b. The Driver Object Mapping Layer

We will illustrate this with the `Vet` in this [package](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/tree/master/src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/vet/db)

1.  Define an `@Entity` where object attributes matches the table columns [`VetEntity`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/vet/db/VetEntity.java)

2. Define an `@Dao` interface with only the method you want to implements [`VetReactiveDao`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/vet/db/VetReactiveDao.java)

```java
@Dao
public interface VetReactiveDao {

 @Select
 MappedReactiveResultSet<VetEntity> findById(@NotNull UUID vetId);

 // More methods....
}
```

3. Define the `@Mapper` to explain how to create the `Dao` from the the Cqlsession. [`VetReactiveDaoMapper`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/vet/db/VetReactiveDaoMapper.java)

```java
@Mapper
public interface VetReactiveDaoMapper {
  @DaoFactory
  VetReactiveDao vetDao(@DaoKeyspace CqlIdentifier keyspace);
}
```

Now execute the test to work with the DAO `Test03_DaoWithDriverObjectMapping`

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test03_DaoWithDriverObjectMapping
```

## 9. Working with Spring Data

[Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) provides a common astraction on top of multiple databases leveraging JPA. The quantity of code is greatly reduce by working with interfaces `CrudRepository` and entities.

- Define an entity [`VetEntitySpring`]() where object attributes matches the table columns. You can notice that the set of annotations is not the same as with java driver mapper.






## 10. Working with Apis

## 11. Working with user interface


```
 cd /workspace/workshop-spring-reactive/spring-petclinic-angular
 npm run start
```
